My project is titled "CSRR-loaded Dual Band E-shaped Slot Antenna for Biomedical Applications." The goal of this project is to design a compact and efficient antenna that can be used in wearable or implantable medical devices to enable wireless health monitoring. The antenna uses an E-shaped slot design, which helps in achieving multi-band performance, improved signal quality, and a more compact sizeâ€”making it suitable for small biomedical devices. To further enhance its performance, the antenna is loaded with CSRR (Complementary Split Ring Resonator) structures, which are special metamaterial patterns that improve resonance, reduce size, and allow the antenna to block unwanted signals. The antenna is designed to operate in dual frequency bands, typically around 2.4 GHz (used in wearable sensors like smart health bands) and 400 MHz (used in implantable devices like pacemakers). These dual bands allow for real-time health monitoring with low power consumption. The project focuses on important biomedical requirements such as miniaturization, biocompatibility, high efficiency, and low Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) to ensure it is safe and effective for human use. Overall, this antenna offers key advantages such as a small footprint, dual-band flexibility, and reliable wireless performance, making it ideal for applications in remote patient monitoring, wearable health sensors, and smart medical devices.
